Export perturbation vectors from CLASS in hdf5 format. The perturbation
vectors are source functions T(k,tau) as a function of scale and
conformal time.

Requires:
HDF5, CLASS

How to use:

1) Download and install CLASS v. 2.9.2 or later.
2) Download and install classex.
3) Change the parameter file default.ini to select the desired transfer functions,
   desired units, and to point classex to parameter (and optional precision) files
   to pass on to CLASS.
4) Run ./classex default.ini
