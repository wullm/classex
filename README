Export perturbation vectors from CLASS in hdf5 format. The perturbation
vectors are source functions T(k,tau) as a function of scale and
conformal time.

How to use:

1) Download and install the fork of CLASS v. 2.9.2 from wullm/class_public.

(Alternatively, you could download the main version and change the Makefile
to create a shared library libclass.so, which classex needs to run.)

2) Download and install classex.
3) Change the parameter file default.ini to select the desired transfer functions,
   desired units, and to point classex to parameter (and optional precision) files
   to pass on to CLASS.
4) Run ./classex default.ini
